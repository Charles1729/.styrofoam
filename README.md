# fortis
## Info
fortis.sty LaTeX template.  Created originally to be used for OTIS, the [online olympiad training program](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) by Evan Chen, but now used for other intents and purposes.  The name is a portmanteaux of the words "for" and "otis" (which I admit, is not at all creative), but it stuck.

## Usage
For usage, see Evan Chen's usage document for his sty (evan.sty) on his website: [https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html#L-3](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html#L-3).
