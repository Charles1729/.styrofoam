# .styrofoam
## Info
A LaTeX .sty and .tex storage repository.

### Contents
- fortis.sty LaTeX template.  Created originally to be used for OTIS, the [online olympiad training program](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) by Evan Chen, but now used for other intents and purposes.  The name is a portmanteaux of the words "for" and "otis" (which I admit, is not at all creative), but it stuck.
  - Intended usage: General writeups, solutions, etc.
- amuser.sty LaTeX template.  Created originally for my own resume, but then some people wanted to use it (ahem RG, RC) so I just published it here.  "resume" spelt backwards and re-spelt.
  - Intended usage: Resumes only.
- demo folder.  Just a folder containing demo/example .tex and .pdf usages of these .sty files.  Updated less frequently than the .sty themselves, so be aware.


## Usage
For usage, see Evan Chen's usage document for his sty (evan.sty) on his website: [https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html#L-3](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html#L-3).
